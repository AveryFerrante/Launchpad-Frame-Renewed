# LpfRenewed

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.
This is a "v2" of my original Launchpad Frame (LPF) project. I felt I had enough new information/skills and that I was early enough in the project that a fresh rewrite was warranted (classic).

## Idea

This project is aimed at being a "collaborative digital picture frame." Friends can be a part of "frames" where they can all upload photos. The frame has a "view" mode where a fullscreen slideshow of the pictures are shown. This will all be real time meaning new photos will show up in the rotation as they are uploaded by new users.

## Technology

Firebase, Angular 8, NgRx 8, Angular Material 8, AngularFire (wrapper around the firebase SDK for Angular)



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
